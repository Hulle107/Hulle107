## üòä About me

I have a passion for IT and have gained experience in several different programming languages. My heart beats for working with servers, databases, and security. As a person, I am a mix of creativity and precision, and I place great emphasis on details. I value honest and informal communication and thrive in an environment where diversity is welcomed.
